# The Embodiment of AI

The chat format is quite useful, but many people feel that it falls short—that this new technology deserves a new form of interaction. I’m not referring only to a new interface, but to **new hardware** through which we relate to it.

Throughout 2024 and 2025, several early attempts emerged to “embody” AI in physical devices. In January 2024, **Rabbit R1** was unveiled—essentially an Android app stuffed into a quirky device with a scroll wheel. In April of the same year came the **Humane Pin**, worn on the chest and capable of projecting text onto the user’s hand. Later, in September 2025, **Friend** appeared, a more traditional necklace-shaped device.  
So far, all of these attempts have ended in failure: poor execution and a value proposition that never quite clicked.

Curiously, the device that *has* been a success **doesn’t revolve around AI**: **Meta’s glasses**. They’re designed to record video, play music, and handle calls; the AI assistant is just an add-on. In their second version, released in September 2025 (with an integrated display in the lens and a temple with an EMG reader), they show enormous promise. Still, the product is not built *around* AI. Perhaps that’s precisely why it works: it doesn’t try to be “the ultimate device,” it just tries to be useful.

That said, where expectations are most concentrated is in the collaboration between **OpenAI and Jony Ive**, Apple’s legendary designer. In May 2025, it was announced that OpenAI had acquired Ive’s startup and team for **$6.5 billion**, with the goal of creating new AI-centered devices that, according to their promises, could change everything.

We’ll have to wait and see what they unveil. It seems that the proper embodiment of a technology can take years to emerge… and may come from the place we least expect.
